            <p class="theText">Players starting in one of the first area’s of From Software’s 2011 hit video game ‘Dark Souls’, called the Undead Burg, 
                have a chance to stumble upon a locked door. The key for this door can be found on a corpse later in the level. 
                Upon opening the door the player discovers a circular stairway that leads down a tower containing a heavily armored knight, wielding a large mace. The identity of this figure is not mentioned, so who was this figure and why was he locked inside this tower?
                </p><p class="theTextIndented">The identity of the man is revealed during a later section of the game, where the player traverses Anor Londo, a 
                heavily-walled city modelled after the Duomo in Milan. In a hidden cellar, the player discovers the exact same 
                armor of the figure. The item description reads: 

            <br><br><br>
            <i>"Armor worn by Havel the Rock's warriors. Carved from solid rock, its tremendous weight is matched only 
            by the defense it provides. Havel's warriors never flinched nor retreated from battle. Those unfortunate 
            enough to face them were inevitably beaten to a pulp."</i>
            <br><br><br></p>

            <p class="theText">With the identity of the man being confirmed as Havel the Rock, the question of the circumstance in which the 
            player encounters him remains. Later descriptions of items related to Havel describe him as a likely part of the army of Gwyn, 
            the gamified god of the Sun and main antagonist of Dark Souls. The cathedral in which Havel's armor is discovered used to be the 
            home of this mythical figure, implying that it was stored here for his former friend. Perhaps Gwyn locked up his former friend to 
            prevent him from ‘hollowing’, a fate exclusive to the human inhabitants of Dark Souls which is implied to be worse than death, making 
            Havels imprisonment a merciful action despite the fact that his hollowing was inevitable.
        </p><p class="theTextIndented">The chest containing the armor however also holds a ‘occult club’. Weapons classified as ‘occult’ are mentioned to be very effective 
                 against godly creatures, such as Gwyn, which in turn implies that Havel was perhaps intending on aggressively ending his bond with his 
                 former ally and was therefore imprisoned to prevent such events from occurring. This discovery sparked debate within the community of the 
                 game. One theory states that Seith the Scaleless, a traitorous dragon and ally to Gwyn, used the occult club to frame Havel, who despised 
                 Seiths magical studies. Others suggested that not Gwyn, but an unknown blacksmith whose remains are found at the place where the key unlocking
                  the door to the tower is found could have been the one to lock Havel down. 
                </p><p class="theTextIndented">Adherents of the first theory find their opinions represented in the lore-explaining videos of youtuber Vaatividya, whose youtube-channel 
                 became a pillar of what has become the canonical view of the lore behind the Dark Souls series. One of his most viewed videos encompasses 
                 the whole lore of the three Dark souls games, in which he discusses and analyses the history of the world of Lordran, Drangleic and Lothrick. 
                 Vaatividya’s videos are composed of strings of lore, which are painstakingly stitched together by hundreds of Dark Souls players into a single 
                 narrative. Their main sources for these theories are the item descriptions or ‘flavor text’ on each item in the games and the associated visuals 
                 that the surrounding location gives us. In fact, these hints of the past are the main story-telling device From Software uses in the Dark souls 
                 trilogy, which sparked the fascination of many critics.
                </p><p class="theTextIndented">Vaatividya himself has created various videos about certain subjects in more detail, revising them whenever sequels granted the community more 
                 information on the story. Others have analyzed different aspects of the game. In his six-and-a-half hours commentary playthrough of the game, 
                 Youtuber and games-journalist MatthewMatosis mentions the attention to detail that From Software gave to visual story-telling and item descriptions, 
                 partly to ensure that the  gameplay won’t be interrupted by unnecessary cutscenes. Dark Souls' story, according to Matosis, contains details of real world 
                 history that make it more believable as a grander world. Examples of this are the logic of the architecture the player encounters, such as the broken down 
                 archway that leads to Anor Londo(which is never used, but makes sense since it does lead to a familiar place) and the coloring of royal clothing in 
                 what used to be expensive dyes(the yellow clothes of Xanthus King Jeremiah).
                </p><p class="theTextIndented">Written works about the game also highlight several aspects woven within its storytelling. The Gemsbok’s Dan Podgorski wrote an essay 
                 in 2019 about the existentialist themes of the larger Dark Souls lore, citing Jean-Paul Satre, Simone de Beauvior and Albert Camus in his 
                 build-up to five different conclusions of the game. The first one on these goes as follows:
            <br><br><br>
            <i>“Dark Souls is a game about motivation and authenticity. In the early existentialist sense that crops up so often in the works of figures 
                like Sartre and Camus, it is about carrying on against the overwhelming and potentially discouraging nature of reality. And in a wider existentialist 
                sense, it is about deriving meaning from moments of human authenticity and from self-assigned goals—regardless of the broader apparent meaninglessness 
                of physical reality and the inevitable end of the world.”</i>
                <br><br><br></p>
            
            
            <p class="theText">Podgorski mainly focused his essay on the larger lore being told in the game and themes within this lore, however he 
            also made conclusions about that story-telling that are mentioned in this piece. Lastly, game-critic Keza Macdonald detailed her experience with the 
            game in You Died: the Dark Souls Companion, in which she details aspects of the game itself and the community, including the sometimes toxic nature of 
            the ‘non-casual’ parts of this community.
        </p><p class="theTextIndented">Besides MatthewMatosis and Podorski however, none of the literature written or spoken about the game place their focus on the inspirations of its 
                 source-driven story-telling. It is however, a unique way of story-telling that's worth discussing, since it conjures the same kind of discussions 
                 between theoretical models as real world history does. How did From Software do this, what is the link with real world history as a profession and 
                 what can be learned from this way of telling stories in video games? In this essay, I will attempt to answer the following question: how does the 
                 story-telling in From Software’s 2011 Dark Souls relate to historical research?
                </p><p class="theTextIndented">To answer this question, I will supply several examples of the usage of sources in Dark Souls, which I will compare to how sources are studied with what 
                 has been labeled as the ‘historical method’ in academic historical research. With this comparison, I aim to explain how Dark Souls is an example of a 
                 possible training ground  for certain skills required by historians and others academic fields. I will then give some suggestions on how this example could 
                 be used by students of history and schools (mainly secondary education), after which I will formulate the answer to the question at the core of this essay. 
                 To do this, I will use the earlier mentioned literature, as well as reference several item-descriptions and environmental details that are part of the game. 
                 Lastly, I will include information by the developers of the game given throughout the years since its release back in 2011, mainly those of director Hidetake 
                 Miyazaki, who created the concept of what is now known as the ‘Soulsborne’ genre(which include Demon Souls, Dark Souls 1-3, Bloodborne and Sekiro: shadows die 
                 Twice).
                 <br><br><br>

            <strong>The age of fire</strong><br></p>
        <p class="theText">Dark Souls is, similar to its predecessor Demon's Souls, generally well known as what is considered a ‘hard game’. Unlike many other role-playing games, 
            even the common enemies in Dark Souls pose a serious threat to the progress of the player, as a few well placed hits can drain his/her health bar to zero. 
            A death in Dark Souls sends the player back to the last visited bonfire, after which all enemies across the world (with an exception for bosses and mini-bosses) 
            respawn. This means that the player has to progress between bonfires in one go, as a failure resulting in death means that all the progress made so far is lost. 
            On the one hand, this punishes players for being reckless and not learning the enemies’ movement enough. On the other hand however, this system gives the player 
            a significant sense of achievement when reaching a new bonfire, as it shows he/she has mastered the previous obstacle course.
        </p><p class="theTextIndented">These bonfires are meant to be a checkpoint system for the game, but they also have a ‘lore’ explanation to them. In the introductory cutscene, the shaping 
                 of the world is explained to the player in a similar vein as mythological stories of the current order. The world used to be a dark place where only massive 
                 trees stood and everliving stone dragons roamed. This changed when fire was discovered (perhaps alluding to the importance of fire to the development of human 
                 civilization) and from the first flame souls came forth. These souls were then picked up by four lords, who became the gods of the world of Lordran, the 
                 fictional land in which the game takes place. The first lord mentioned is Nito, first of the dead, an amalgamation of corpses that resides in the Tomb of 
                 Giants. The second lord is the Witch of Izalith, who created demons and resides within Old Izalith. The third lord is Gwyn, the lord of sunlight, who serves 
                 as the creator of what Lordran has become. The last remaining lord is the furtive pygmy, who is implied to be the ancestor of mankind.
                </p><p class="theTextIndented">Of these four lords, Gwyn became the most influential. Wielding his lightning bolts and allying up with Nito and the witch of Izalith to defeat the ancient 
                 dragons in a style similar to how ancient Greek pantheons seemed to succeed each other through all-out war. He created what has been dubbed as the  ‘Age of Fire’ 
                 the period of time in which the game takes place. As long as the first flame holds this age continues. This turned out to be a problem, as the flame started to 
                 die out within an unknown period of time before the player character starts its journey. To prevent this, Gwyn ‘linked’ the fire, which reinvigorated the flames.
                </p><p class="theTextIndented">The player is never told what the process of ‘linking the fire’ entails, although many item-descriptions and encountered characters on the way to the end of the 
                 game refer to it. What is described however is the undead curse that came after Gwyn linked the fire. It turned out that some denizens of the world of Lordran 
                 were cursed with undeath, meaning that they would be raised up from the dead with slightly less ‘humanity’ in them each time they died. If this process happened 
                 too many times, the cursed undead might ‘hollow’, becoming a zombie-like hostile figure. The hollows of Dark Souls are the main enemies encountered in the game,
                  and hollowing is considered a horrible faith by the other cursed undead the player encounters. Generally, hollowing has been likened by the community as a 
                  form of ‘giving up’ on life and personal goals, similar to how depression can manifest itself in the real world. The player starts out as a cursed undead 
                  inside an asylum built especially to hold such individuals. Many of the other denizens have already gone hollow, which the player can prevent from happening 
                  to itself by offering ‘humanity’ as an item to bonfires along the road. 
                </p><p class="theTextIndented">This is not the only useful feature the bonfires have in Dark Souls. Players generally have two options to increase their characters ability to traverse the 
                 world of Dark Souls to the next bonfire: to use in-game currency or ‘souls’, to level up their character or to obtain weapons and/or armor that increases the 
                 players chances of fending off enemies. The first option more or less results in character development as it is known in many roleplaying games. As the player 
                 prefers a certain playstyle, they tend to upgrade their characters' statistics to benefit them in the greatest way possible. For example, a heavily armored 
                 knight character would prefer to increase its strength over the duration of the game, so it can hit its enemies harder and deal more damage, whilst a magic 
                 type character would prefer to upgrade the attributes that influence the chances of successfully harnessing the power of his/her spells.
                </p><p class="theTextIndented">Leveling up allows the player to equip new armor and weapons. Most of these items can be found on enemies, corpses in the desolated areas the player visits 
                 or chests hidden away from view. One example of this is a dagger called ‘Ricard’s rapier’, which is gained upon slaying an undead archer at the top of a 
                 massive castle labeled as ‘Sen's Fortress’. This area serves as a barrier for every mortal trying to enter the city of the Gods(Anor Londo), which is one of 
                 the main area’s the player needs to visit to complete the game. As the player climbs on the highest spires of the fortress, the unknown archer attacks the 
                 player. The archer switches to using a rapier as the player comes closer, who can barely overcome the nimble foe. When the player does overcome the archer, 
                 the rapier drops, which reads:

                 <br><br><br>
                 <i>“A rapier with intricate decorations. Chosen weapon of the famous Undead Prince Ricard. Ricard's exploits are told in a monomyth. He was born into royalty, 
                     but wandered the lands in a fateful ill-conceived journey. He became Undead and disappeared up North." </i>
            <br><br><br></p>

        <p class="theText">From this description, it can be concluded that the former wielder of the rapier was Undead Prince Ricard. As he also carries a buckler, his fighting style 
            resembles that of the knights of Balder, who can be encountered in the earlier stages of the games up to Sen’s fortress. These knights can be a large obstacle 
            to the player, because of their quick strikes and fast paced movement. Pieces of their armor carry with them the story of their homeland:
            
            <br><br><br>
            <i>“Armor worn by the knights of the ancient kingdom of Balder. It is made from thick iron plates. Balder was the homeland of the Knight King Rendal, but 
                it came to ruin after a great many Undead were spawned.“ </i>
                <br><br><br></p>

            <p class="theText">The kingdom of Balder was ruled by Knight King Rendal, who tried to reach Anor Londo according to what an earlier seen merchant told the player:
            
            <br><br><br>
            <i>“Let me give a nibble of advice. Don't even consider visiting Anor Londo. Not in your state. For a century, they have tried, and failed. The Knight 
                King Rendal, Black Iron Tarkus, and even Logan himself. You won't stand a chance. You'll be eaten alive. But, go along, if you wish. If only to deepen 
                your despair!”.</i>
                <br><br><br></p>

            <p class="theText">With this information at hand, the general consensus among the player base is that Ricard was the son of this Knight King Rendal and led his fathers knights 
            into Sen’s Fortress, where they failed in their quest to reach Anor Londo.
        </p><p class="theTextIndented">The player then walks, not knowing how much time has passed, through the aftermath of this expedition and other events that brought the world of Lordran 
                 to ruin. The items that give us glimpses of the past are nothing more than incidental objects of what once must have been an eventful era. In this way, 
                 Dark Souls places the player in the role of the historian, trying to recreate an image of what has been lost in time by what has been preserved through 
                 chance. 
                </p><p class="theTextIndented">A common misconception about the historical profession is that historians tend to summarize known facts by quantity and that the memorization of this is 
                 what entails as historical research. In fact, historical research tends to be quite the opposite, as historians are trained to focus their energy on details 
                 of the narrative not yet known or hotly debated. What detail of the past is not yet described, why and is it possible to do so? In order to increase our 
                 common historical body of knowledge the historian then seeks to find sources that are relevant to the chosen subject. Generally, the further back in time 
                 the historian goes, the less available sources can be found and used. After gathering enough of them, the historian should then put these sources under 
                 scrutiny, using what has been dubbed as the historical method. This involves questioning the details about each source, like the contents, date of creation, 
                 by who and for who it has been made. Lists have been made to clarify the procedure historians should undertake, such as Gilbert J. Garraghans and Jean 
                 Delanglezs six points: 
            
                 <br><br><br>
            <i>1. When was the source, written or unwritten, produced (date)?<br>
            2. Where was it produced (localization)?<br>
            3. By whom was it produced (authorship)?<br>
            4. From what pre-existing material was it produced (analysis)?<br>
            5. In what original form was it produced (integrity)?<br>
            6. What is the evidential value of its contents (credibility)? </i>
            <br><br><br></p>

        <p class="theText">Although there are different examples of the historical method, most come down to the principles touched by these six points. With the answers to these questions, 
            historians start to better understand the context of the sources they have discovered and the questions that can be asked and answered with them. What parts of the 
            past can be reconstructed with these sources and, as important, what cannot be said based on these sources? Let us look back at Dark Souls for an example of this line 
            of questioning. The merchant that informed the player about Knight King Rendal also mentions a figure known as Iron Tarkus. According to the npc(non-playable character)
             this figure also tried to enter Anor Londo, but fell to the same fate as Rendal and Ricard. The testimony of the merchants seems to be based on what he
              has seen himself or heard from other travellers. As the merchant is found in Sen’s Fortress itself, chances are that all the information he had gained 
              is based on that area and the earlier ones. This is confirmed when the player overcomes the fortress, as Iron Tarkus can be called upon to aid him or her 
              in defeating the guardian of Anor Londo, the Iron Golem. After this battle, the player is flown to the outer walls of Anor Londo, where the merchant has 
              never set foot. At one point in the journey, the road in the city of the gods is blocked by a closed-off pathway. To the left, the player discovers a broken 
              window on the other side of an archway, which can be climbed. 
            </p><p class="theTextIndented">As the player enters the window, he/she is forced to balance atop the rafters of the church-like structure, ending in a ladder slide down the other side. 
                 On the ground-floor, the player battles several enemies called ‘painting guardians’, after which the body of a warrior can be found in one of the corners of 
                 the central hallway. On this corpse, the player can find the armor of Iron Tarkus, concluding that he did make it through Sen's Fortress, but failed to 
                 properly balance his heavy armor on the small rafters as the player did and fell to his death. The armor reinforces this idea by stating:

                 <br><br><br>
            <i>“Armor set of Black Iron Tarkus, a knight known for his great strength. Built of a special black iron and providing strong defense, notably 
                against fire, but so terribly heavy to be unwieldy to all but Tarkus himself.” </i>
                <br><br><br></p>

            <p class="theText">In this example, the player is given several clues, or rather sources, of what happened to Iron Tarkus before the current time. The merchant's testimony, 
                 the presence of Tarkus at the fight with the Iron Golem, the item-description of his armor and the presence of this armor in Anor Londo on (most probably) 
                 his corpse are all sources that have to be carefully examined. Let us ask the six questions mentioned earlier to see how this works. Firstly the sources are 
                 produced at an unknown period of time before the players arrival and in the same order as the player discovers them, since Iron Tarkus takes the same journey 
                 to Anor Londo as the player does. Secondly, the localization of the sources can be split into two places: Sen’s Fortress (testimony of the merchant) and Anor 
                 Londo(Iron Tarkus’ remains and armor). This is an important detail to factor into the equation, because these two areas are separated by a large wall that 
                 surrounds the much higher elevated Anor Londo. The merchant, not able to witness the city, would not know of what really happened to Tarkus, with which we 
                 already have the first clue to why his testimony doesn’t correspond with what the player finds out later on. This also factors in question number three, because 
                 the merchant is the one that creates his testimony based on information that is not based on anything in Anor Londo.
                </p><p class="theTextIndented">Contrary to the information the merchant gives , the armor of Iron Tarkus is found on the floor of the cathedral based on pure chance. There is no retelling 
                 of information or influence from other interpretations: the armor tells the story of what happened to Tarkus based on its location and the state of the wearer. 
                 This makes it much more reliable as a source than the merchant's testimony, as the player doesn’t have to factor in the same subjective factors. The 
                 fourth question is not that relevant to this example, though it can be argued that, as the armor actually exists as an object and not merely as testimony, 
                 it should be seen as a more valuable source of information. The information the merchant gives can also be seen as not credible based on the name of this 
                 figure. The ‘crestfallen’ merchant is crestfallen, because he failed in his duty to reach Anor Londo. To soften the shock of this disgrace, he might be tempted 
                 to play down the achievements of others such as Richard, Rendal and Tarkus, as to not be seen as the only one that has failed in his duty. Therefore, the armor 
                 can be seen as more reliable when questioning its credibility, as there is no motivation for it to twist information as there is with the testimony of the 
                 merchant. Adding up all these arguments, one has to conclude that the later found sources including the armor and corpse of Iron Tarkus, tell a much more
                  reliable story of what happened to him than the testimony of the merchant the player encounters in Sen’s Fortress.
                </p><p class="theTextIndented">The stories of Havel, Richard, Knight King Rendal and Iron Tarkus can easily be missed if the player does not review the sources in the game critically. Although 
                 the main mythology is told within the opening cutscene, most of the story-telling requires the player to weigh different snippets of lore against each other. From 
                 Software took a risky approach to story exposition, but it paid off with a unique training environment for using the historical method on sources. History in 
                 video games normally comes down to representing certain historical settings as portrayed in Assassin's Creed or Age of Empires. What makes Dark Souls stand out 
                 is its focus on historical research as part of a professional skill set as opposed to a simple background-set used to make the main story stand out. This skill
                  set can often be useful outside of the field of history, which is one argument that should (but sadly often isn’t) be made for history to remain a core part 
                  of the general education of every individual. To be able to analyse the context of information, determine how the gathering of information influences the content
                   and to conclude what is reliable and what isn’t are critical skills that historical research requires and trains, though Dark Souls enters the scene as a 
                   worthy training ground for anyone wanting to practice being a historian, a ‘historical research for dummies’, as it were.
                </p><p class="theTextIndented">More examples of story-telling that demand critical review come later in the game. As the player travels through Anor Londo and defeats the legendary bosses
                  Ornstein and Smough (who, according to some fantheories, are not really battling the player but are merely facades of glorious days gone), the second part 
                  of Dark Souls unlocks. Here, the player can choose four paths that all have to be completed to unlock the final boss Gwyn, the lord of fire. From Anor Londo,
                   the closest path leads the player to the Duke archives, a maze-like library filled with magical tomes. The ‘Duke’ that owns this archive is the earlier
                    mentioned Seith the Scaleless, a dragon who gained his title by betraying his kind and siding with Gwyn in Dark Souls’ version of the Titanomachy: the war 
                    in which a new patheon replaces the old. The player confronts Seith in an unbeatable battle at the halfway-point of the archives. This confrontation leads 
                    to the player being captured and imprisoned in a circular prison, also known as a panopticon.
                </p><p class="theTextIndented">As the player makes his/her inevitable escape from their cell, the guards unlock other inmates to prevent the player from reaching them. At the bottom of the 
                 panopticon lies the cell containing most of these foes, who are dubbed by the ingame-text as ‘Pisaca’s’, blue tentacled snake-women ready to grab the player 
                 the moment they come in range. Defeating these monsters allows the player to enter their former cell, where two more Pisaca’s are still present, softly crying
                  and ignoring the player. Unlike the others, these two enemies do not engage the player, only slithering away when they are attacked. Both of these Pisaca’s 
                  drop a ‘miracle’, Dark Souls version of ‘good’ magic. These are counted as items, which means that they also have an item-description. They also share a very 
                  similar name, Bountiful and Soothing Sunlight, of which the description states:
                  
                  <br><br><br>
            <i>“Special miracle granted to the maidens of Gwynevere, Princess of the Sun. Restores high HP for self and vicinity. The miracles of Gwynevere, the princess cherished 
            by all, grant their blessing to a great many warriors.“ </i>
            <br><br><br></p>

        <p class="theText">With this text, the observant lore enthusiasts quickly concluded that the maidens of Gwynevere are the Pisaca’s that carried the miracles. Their lady Gwynevere (or 
            at least a mirage of her) is encountered earlier in Anor Londo, as she is the daughter of Gwyn and the goddess of fertility. The question remains why these maidens 
            look like the monstrosities that are encountered in the panopticon: a question asked and answered when the player discoveres the key in a further part of the archive 
            that opens up another cell door. The description on this key states:

            <br><br><br>
            <i>“Key to the giant cell below the Duke's Archives Tower. The giant cell once imprisoned countless maidens, but is now empty, save for a few key persons. They struggle 
            to uphold their sanity, as the horde of "mistakes" writhe at a fearfully close proximity.” </i>
            <br><br><br></p>

        <p class="theText">The ‘horde of mistakes’ mentioned are clearly the group of pisaca’s locked up in the earlier cell, which uncovers a dark part of what happened in the Duke’s archives. 
            Besides studying the thousands of manuscripts scattered about, it seems that the dragon Seith also conducted experiments in his search to find immortality. The victims 
            of the experiments, the ‘mistakes’, were the maidens of Gwynevere and perhaps others of Lordran. These victims turned into the monstrosities that hunt the player 
            throughout the panopticon. Perhaps this explains the hatred Havel had for Seith the Scaleless.
        </p><p class="theTextIndented">Again, Dark Souls’ storytelling requires the player to pay attention to what the sources state in order to understand the world. The unobservant player would have
                  brushed the pisaca’s away as just another weird enemy-type, whilst the details of the items and surroundings make the hidden backstory of Seiths victims an 
                  essential yet tragic part of the archives’ history. By studying and comparing these different sources, the player can puzzle their way to the tragic details of
                   what happened in the world of Lordran, even though the clues at a first glance seem impossible to connect.
                 This struggle exemplifies how difficult it can be for historians to attempt to reconstruct a part of the past that has not been analysed well enough. Imagine for 
                 example, that either the miracles or the key were missing in the story of the pisaca’s: the story written based on both these sources would have become impossible 
                 to conclude or would even lead to completely different concepts of what the pisaca’s might have been. Similarly, history is written based on sources that partly 
                 became available for historians by chance. This then clarifies why historical knowledge on virtually most subjects is ever evolving, as more sources are uncovered
                  and more insights are gained, changing our understanding of the past.
                </p><p class="theTextIndented">The information gained by reading item-descriptions and factoring in environmental clues give more insight on the side-stories contained in the game, but aspects 
                 of the historical method can also be applied to the main journey the players make themselves. Halfway through the game, the player meets kingseeker Frampt, a 
                 massive snake-like creature that instructs the player to go travel to go to Anor Londo, collect an essential item, defeat several tough enemies (including the 
                 earlier mentioned Nito and the witch of Izalith) and ‘link the fire’ in the same vein as Gwyn did. Frampt calls himself a friend of Gwyn and his Age of Fire while 
                 providing the player with the goals that need to be achieved. He doesn't, however, mention what ‘linking the fire’ entails. All throughout the game, the player 
                 is encouraged to pursue this, as Frampt makes it sound like this simply means taking on Gwyns throne as the lord of sunlight. In reality, linking the fire is the 
                 process of sacrificing oneself to the first flame, in which the player's character becomes fully consumed. This prolongs the age of fire and the existence of 
                 the world as we know it, but also requires the ultimate sacrifice of the one doing the linking. Frampt never mentions this, as his motivations are clearly to 
                 save Gwyns status quo.
                </p><p class="theTextIndented">Frampt is not the only serpent the player can encounter in Lordran. If the player decides to defeat the Four Kings, a difficult boss fight meant to be tackled 
                 in the later half of the game, before meeting Frampt, they might encounter Darkstalker Kaathe. Kaathe has a similar appearance to Frampt, but does not side with 
                 him in his attempt of finding a new candidate to link the fire. Instead, Kaathe seeks to let the first flame die out, so that a new era can start in which humanity 
                 becomes the new ruling class. Kaathe gives the same guidance as Frampt does, leading the player to the Kiln of the First Flame where the player confronts a hollowed 
                 Gwyn, but gives the player the choice to link the fire or walk away, both leading to a different ending of the game.
                </p><p class="theTextIndented">Kaathe’s choice should however not be seen as the ‘good’ ending, just because he doesn’t trick the player into sacrificing him/herself. As the player leaves the 
                 Kiln where the first flame dies off, he/she is ushered in as the ‘dark lord’ by several snake-like creatures similar to Kaathe and Frampt. This age of dark is the 
                 great unknown in the Dark Souls universe, although the factions aligned with it seem to illustrate a twisted version of reality as a future for humanity. Kaathe is 
                 also mentioned as the instigator for what happened to the ancient city of Oolacile, a place that sank into a hellish dark pit known as the ‘Abyss’ which the player 
                 visits in the games’ downloadable content.
                </p><p class="theTextIndented">Which of the two primordial serpents then, should the player trust? A clear answer is not possible, as both snakes give different testimonies based on their 
                 alignments and motivations. If the choice really matters is up to the player, as the sequels seem to indicate that if the player doesn’t link the fire, at least 
                 someone else will. This choice does illustrate how subjective both sides of an argument can be. Neither Frampts or Kaathe’s testimony can be taken as completely 
                 credible when applying the historical method, as both have clear motivations to trick the player in doing their bidding. In fact, only by understanding the 
                 fallacies in Frampts word and disobeying his instructions does the player get a chance in finding out Kaathe’s side of the coin, which in turn exemplifies the 
                 importance of critically reviewing all sources.
                 <br><br><br>

            <strong>Conclusion</strong><br></p>
        <p class="theText">At the beginning of this essay, I mentioned the central question to be: how does the story-telling in From Software's 2011Dark Souls relate to historical 
             research? The world of Dark Souls is a mysterious unexplored realm for the beginning player. After the introductory cutscene the story is never plainly told 
             to the player, leaving many wondering what really happened in Lordran when they played through it. There are however, many smaller stories contained within 
             the game, which can be uncovered by the player through careful study of environmental clues and item-descriptions. 
            </p><p class="theTextIndented">This story-telling device resembles the path 
             historians thread when analyzing sources through careful study and use of the historical method. In this way, Dark Souls’s storytelling is an example of video 
             games training and (if the player really wishes to understand the plot of the game) requiring its player to apply real world skills to fully experience what the 
             game has to offer. Unlike other well-known triple-A video-games, Dark Souls doesn’t heavily rely on history to provide a background-story, rather it is influenced
              by the way historians attempt to recreate aspects of the past through remaining pieces of what once was, and therefore serves as an excellent example of video games 
              being able to train real-life skills. Perhaps this concept could one day be built into a teaching tool that history teachers could use to help their students grasp 
              the essence of historical research.
